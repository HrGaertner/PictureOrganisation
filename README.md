# PictureOrganisation

This program should work and delete your duplicates and as well sort them and was tested but in the end i was too afraid to delete something so i used [fdupes](https://www.tecmint.com/fdupes-find-and-delete-duplicate-files-in-linux/)

For further Organization I would recommend [digikam](https://www.digikam.org/)

## Usage
python3 PicOrga.py -s #The directory where the pictures are currently (required, end with / ) -d #destination directory (where should the picture finally be placed) -r #Remove duplicate Pictures -p # ignore files which do not end with an picture name (e.g. .png, .jpeg and so on)
